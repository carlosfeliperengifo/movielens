The MovieLens dataset used in this project comprises 10 millions ratings for 10677 movies rated by 69878 users. The scale for the rating goes from 0 to 5 with increments of 0.5. The product between the number of users and the number of movies is close to 746 millions, which is greater than the number of ratings. This difference indicates that not every user rated every movie. The MovieLens dataset has six columns which are: (1) the movie identifier, (2) the user identifier, (3) the rating of the movie, (4) a time stamp with the date of the rating, (5) the title of the movie, and (6) the genres of the movie. The purpose of this project is to build a linear model to predict the rating rm,u that the user u will give to the movie m.
